# My Capstone Project 🎓

Hey! 👋 This is my final project for my course. I built this web app using React and Vite because they're super fast and fun to work with!

## What's This All About? 🤔

This is a web application I built for my capstone project. It's got all the cool stuff I learned about:

- React for making the UI
- Redux for keeping track of everything
- React Router for moving between pages
- And a bunch of other neat tools!

## How to Use This App 🎮

### Step 1: Getting Started

1. Open the app in your browser
2. You'll see the main page with a list of products
3. If you're new, click the "Login" button in the top right to create an account
4. If you already have an account, just log in!

### Step 2: Shopping Features

- **Browse Products**

  - Scroll through the product cards to see what's available
  - Each product shows an image and name
  - Click "View Details" to learn more about a product

- **Shopping Cart**
  - Add items to your cart while browsing
  - Click the "Cart" button in the navigation to see your items
  - Adjust quantities or remove items as needed
  - When you're ready, proceed to checkout

### Step 3: Admin Features (Admin Users Only)

If you're an admin, you'll see extra controls:

- **Manage Products**

  - Create new products with the form at the top
  - Edit existing products by clicking the "Edit" button
  - Delete products you no longer want to sell

- **User Management**
